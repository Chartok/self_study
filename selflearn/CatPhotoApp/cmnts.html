<!-- the first lesson/assignment: learning HTML making a catPhotoApp with minimal exposure to CSS -->

<!-- one of the very first things usually taught when learning new programming languages is how to make comments for that specific language... in the case of HTML: to insert one or manly line comments, enter the comment text beween the start and ending comment tags displayed below -->
                    <!-- -->

<!-- HTML is an acronym for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE -->

<!-- the way HTML is written and processed by web browsers is with the use of "elements" what have opening tags and closing tags like the ones the comments have been written insde --> 
    
    <!-- the syntax rules of HTML: opening and closing tags must be typed exactly, character for character, otherwise the web browser will not know how to process and transmit important information to and from the user, server/dev team, etc. -->

    <!-- the opening tag consists of the open angle bracket <  -->
        <!-- following the open angle bracket is the tag; the name of the element that tells the web browser what kind of content and information is going to be contained between opening and closing tags -->
        <!-- after the open angle bracket and the tag, the final part of the closing tag is the closed angle bracket >   -->

    <!-- the closing tag is similar to the opening tag in that it starts and ends with the open and close andgle brackets <>  -->
        <!-- the defining feature of the closing tag is the forward slash rigth after the open angle bracket </> -->
    <!-- all together an HTML element looks like this: <html> </html>
    -->
        <!-- what goes between inside the elements and knowing which elements to use for which purpose will be picked up as it is practiced and explored-->
